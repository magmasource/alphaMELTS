alphaMELTS documentation
========================

This is a placeholder for full Read the Docs documentation for all alphaMELTS interfaces coming later this year. In the meantime, the Wiki will be populated with installation instructions for different platforms and interfaces. Information about how the alphaMELTS suite differs from other versions of MELTS (the original GUI, easyMelts, MELTS for Excel, ENKI's Thermoengine...) will also be added.

The [alphaMELTS_presentation.pdf](https://github.com/magmasource/alphaMELTS/blob/main/docs/alphaMELTS_presentation.pdf) file is the latest version of the workshop presentation on alphaMELTS for MATLAB/Python. There is more background to thermodynamic calculations in general, and alphaMELTS in particular, in the other workshop presentations. Partially annotated examples for standalone, MATLAB and Python versions of alphaMELTS are also included in the Workshops repository:
